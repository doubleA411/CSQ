          limitation, routine maintenance. You understand and acknowledge that
          due to circumstances both within and outside of our control, Website

          understand that there may be interruptions in service or events on

          refund of any fees or as a basis for you not to comply with your
          contractual obligations. The Website and Services may reference

          equipment, and software, but we are in no way affiliated with such
          third parties and neither our Services nor the Website are endorsed or
          approved by such third parties. Further, we do not endorse or

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          4. Limitations <br />
          In no event shall Company or its suppliers be liable for any damages
          (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or
          due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to
          use the materials on the Website, even if Company or a
          Company-authorized representative has been notified orally or in
          writing of the possibility of such damage. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND
          UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR
          OTHERWISE) AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WILL COMPANY OR
          COMPANY’S AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
          EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY
          THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
          CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MONETARY OR OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
          LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS
          INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY IN CONNECTION
          WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR WEBSITE AND/OR ANY CONTENT ON THE
          WEBSITE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. YOUR SOLE AND
          EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES OR WEBSITE IS
          TO STOP USING THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT
          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
          WILL EITHER COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO REPAY OR REIMBURSE
          ANY PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU TO COMPANY. Because some jurisdictions do not
          allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability
          for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not
          apply to you. IN THESE STATES, COMPANY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO
          THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
        </p>

          ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE GOVERNED BY THE C2 BIO, LLC AND CSQ BIO, LLC
          (INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY, THE “SELLER”, AS APPLICABLE) TERMS AND
          CONDITIONS OF SALE. ANY PROPOSAL FROM A PURCHASER THAT INCLUDES
          DIFFERENT OR ADDITIONAL TERMS THAT VARY FROM SELLER’S TERMS AND
          CONDITIONS OF SALE ARE OBJECTED TO AND DISALLOWED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
          FOREGOING, ANY SUCH COUNTERPROPOSALS BY PURCHASER SHALL NOT OPERATE AS
          A REJECTION OF THE CONTRACT OF SALE, BUT AS A REJECTION OF THE
          ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT TERM(S).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          1. Formation of Contract. An order is deemed by Seller to be an offer
          to purchase the products identified on that order (“Products”)
          identified on such order by Purchaser, which Seller may accept or
          reject in its sole discretion. Seller’s acceptance of an offer to
          purchase is binding upon Seller only if made by written instrument or,
          if not by written instrument, by shipment of the Products ordered (and
          acceptance by shipment shall only be binding as to the portion of the
          order actually shipped). Any automatic or computer-generated response
          to an order by Seller shall not be deemed acceptance of an order.
          Seller’s acceptance is subject to Seller’s Terms and Conditions of
          Sale stated herein. All sales are final unless otherwise conveyed by
          Seller. By submitting and/or signing an order, the individual and/or
          entity purchasing the Products (“Purchaser”) thereby accepts and
          agrees that Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale shall govern the
          sale of all Products ordered on such order. Seller shall, on
          Purchaser’s behalf, promptly remit such orders accepted by Seller to
          the Product manufacturer and the Product manufacturer shall pack and
          ship the Products specified on the order for delivery to Purchaser.
          Purchaser agrees that Seller does not providing billing or coding
          services or advice and Purchaser, therefore, agrees to work directly
          with the Product manufacturer with respect to all billing and coding
          matters. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that use of the
          any Product shall be at the sole discretion of the treating
          provider(s), exercising his or her independent professional medical
          judgement and Seller has no involvement in or influence on any
          treating provider’s determinations of medical necessity or the
          exercise of their independent professional medical judgment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2. Payment. All payments shall be due and payable as set forth and
          specified on issued invoices in the amounts stated in each invoice,
          within thirty (30) days of date of each invoice. All amounts payable
          hereunder shall be paid when due, time being of the essence. Purchaser
          shall pay invoiced amounts in full within thirty (30) days of the date
          of each invoice regardless of whether Purchaser receives any
          reimbursement or payment from patients or third-party payors for
          Products. Purchaser agrees to provide Credit Card Authorization for
          payment of all invoices by completing and executing the form provided
          by Seller and delivering such completed and executed form to Seller.
          Purchaser authorizes Seller to charge any and all invoiced amounts
          that are not paid within thirty (30) days of the date of each invoice
          by Purchaser to Purchaser’s credit card pursuant to the Credit Card
          Authorization. In the event that Purchaser has not paid any invoiced
          amount in full within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice, any and
          all rebates associated with the Products on that invoice shall be
          automatically forfeited by Purchaser and Purchaser shall have waived
          the opportunity to earn any rebate associated with the purchase of
          such invoiced Products. Purchaser agrees that Seller has the right to
          pursue any available option to Purchaser in the event of Customer’s
          default or delay in payment including, without limitation, engaging a
          collection agency, closing Purchaser’s account with Seller or the
          Product manufacturer, and/or reporting potentially falsely submitted
          claims to commercial and/or government payors. Purchaser further
          agrees to pay all reasonable costs of collection, including reasonable
          attorney fees, in case any invoice is not paid in full within thirty
          (30) days of the date of invoice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          3. Credit. Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, grant credit
          terms to Purchaser and Seller shall not be deemed to have done so
          unless such terms are set forth in writing signed by Seller.
          Acceptance of any order is subject to final credit approval by Seller.
          Seller reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without prior
          notice, to suspend production, shipment and/or deliveries, cancel
          orders, reject future orders, and require cash payments in advance or
          security satisfactory to Seller if Purchaser is in delinquent status
          with Seller.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          4. Cost of Delivery, Taxes and Other Charges. Purchaser shall pay the
          costs of delivery of the products. Purchaser shall pay all sales, use,
          excise or similar taxes, or other charges, which Seller is required to
          pay, or to collect and remit, to any Government (national, state, or
          local) and which are imposed on or measured by the sale.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          5. Transfer of Property and Risk of Loss. Seller retains the right and
          title to the products sold to Purchaser until Seller is paid in full
          for the products. Purchaser shall obtain the right and title to the
          products upon payment to Seller of the purchase price and any taxes,
          excise or other charges. The risk of loss, including, but not limited
          to the risk of loss, theft, damage or destruction of the products,
          transfers to Purchaser [F.O.B. the Product manufacturer’s factory].
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          6. No Set-Off. Purchaser shall have no right of set-off or
          withholding, and no deduction of any amounts due from Purchaser to
          Seller shall be made without Seller’s prior, express written approval.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          7. Patents. Seller reserves the right to discontinue deliveries of any
          products, the manufacture, sale or use of which would, in Seller’s
          opinion, infringe upon any U.S. patent, trademark or design now or
          hereinafter issued, registered, or existing and under which Seller is
          not licensed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          8. Termination. Seller may terminate Seller’s Terms and Conditions of
          Sale relative to any Purchaser without cause upon thirty (30) calendar
          days’ written notice to Purchaser. Seller may immediately terminate
          Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale relative to any Purchaser upon
          written notice to such Purchaser if that Purchaser: (a) has committed
          a material breach of Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale; (b) has
          become insolvent, is dissolved or liquidated; (c) files or has filed
          against it a petition in bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed
          within sixty (60) calendar days of the filing; (d) makes a general
          assignment for the benefit of creditors; (e) has a receiver appointing
          for a substantial part of its assets; and/or (f) is or becomes
          excluded from participating in, or is or becomes ineligible for
          participation in, any federal or state health care program or
          government payment program. Except as otherwise set forth herein, upon
          termination of Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale relative to any
          Purchaser, neither party shall have any further obligation hereunder
          except for obligations accruing prior to the date of termination,
          which obligations include payment obligations of Purchaser in
          accordance with Section 2 hereof. The above notwithstanding, Seller
          may deduct, from any discount or rebate amount it owes Customer, any
          amounts that Purchaser owes Seller.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          9. Disclaimer of Warranties. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN
          SELLER’S WARRANTY DOCUMENTS WITH RESPECT TO A PRODUCT ARE THE ONLY
          WARRANTIES MADE BY SELLER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTS AND THE
          TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED AS A RESULT OF THIS SALE. SELLER MAKES NO
          OTHER WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS TO PURCHASER OR ANY OTHER PERSON
          OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS,
          AND SELLER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING,
          WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. PRODUCTS SOLD HEREUNDER

          SELLER IN WRITING. SELLER’S SOLE OBLIGATION FOR A REMEDY TO PURCHASER
          SHALL BE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF NON-CONFORMING PRODUCTS. PURCHASER

        <br />
        <p>
          10. Limitation of Liability. No claim by Purchaser of any kind
          including, but not limited to, claims for indemnification, whether as
          to quality or amount of Product delivered or non-delivery, shall be
          greater in amount then the purchase price for the Products in respect
          of which damages are claimed. IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER BE LIABLE TO
          ANY PURCHASER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, STATUTORY,

          LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF PURCHASER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY
          FORESEEN.

          business days from the day Purchaser received the Products, Purchaser
          may request a Return Authorization. Where Seller determines that the
          Product cannot be shipped back safely, Seller may, at its sole
          discretion, refuse to issue a Return Authorization or to issue any
          credit. Products must be returned within five (5) calendar days of
          receiving a Return Authorization and must be in the original sealed
          package(s) and unaltered in order to receive a credit. Upon receipt of
          Products that have Return Authorization, a credit for the original
          purchase price less shipping charges, if applicable, will be issued.

          are final.)

          13. Excuses for Non-Performance. If the manufacture, transfer, or
          receipt by either party of any products covered hereby is prevented,
          restricted or interfered with by reason of any event beyond the
          reasonable control of the party so affected, such party shall be
          excused from making or taking deliveries hereunder to the extent of
          such prevention, restriction or interference, and neither party shall
          be liable to the other for default or delay in performing, except with
          respect to Purchaser’s payment obligations. Seller shall not be
          responsible for any failure to comply with the terms of Seller’s Terms

          earthquake; explosion; war or civil commotion; labor disturbance;
          destruction or production facilities or materials; failure of a public
          utility or common carrier; act of God; or any other cause beyond the

          to Seller. If for any reason, the quantities of the products covered
          hereby or of any materials used in the production of the products
          reasonably available to Seller shall be less than Seller total needs
          for its own use and for sale, Seller may allocate its available supply
          of products among its existing or prospective purchasers and/or its
          own departments, divisions and affiliates in such manner Seller deems
          proper in Seller’s sole discretion, without thereby incurring
          liability on account of the method of allocation determined or its
          implementation or for failure to perform under Seller’s Terms and
          Conditions of Sale.

          sole and exclusive statement of the parties’ understanding and
          agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this sale,
          notwithstanding any other terms that might be contained in any
          purchase order or other document received from Purchaser or submitted
          to Seller. These Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale in addition to
          Seller’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which are incorporated
          herein by reference, collectively constitute the entire agreement
          between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and can only
          be modified or changed in writing and signed by Seller. As used
          herein, the expression “Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale” means

          effective unless it is in writing and signed by Seller nor shall such
          waiver constitute or be deemed to be a waiver of any such term or any
          such breach in any other case. No waiver shall be deemed to occur as a
          result of the failure to enforce any term or condition of these
          Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale. If any clause or portion hereof
          shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
          invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining clauses or portions shall
          remain in full force and effect. The paragraph headings are for
          convenience only and shall not be used in interpreting or construing
          these Seller’s Terms and Conditions of Sale. Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 8,
